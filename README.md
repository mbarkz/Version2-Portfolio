# Version2-Portfolio
Using Bootstrap to create an enhanced, responsive portfolio - my most ambitious yet.

## Description

In this weeks challenge, I used Bootstrap to speed up the development process of this site. Knowing that I could effectivley cut corners, I was more ambitious in my design of the site. I tried to go for elements which I could practice using col and row elements such as the hero/jumbotron at the start of the page.
